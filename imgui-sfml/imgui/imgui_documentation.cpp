 MISSION STATEMENT
 =================

 - Easy to use to create code-driven and data-driven tools.
 - Easy to use to create ad hoc short-lived tools and long-lived, more elaborate tools.
 - Easy to hack and improve.
 - Minimize screen real-estate usage.
 - Minimize setup and maintenance.
 - Minimize state storage on user side.
 - Portable, minimize dependencies, run on target (consoles, phones, etc.).
 - Efficient runtime and memory consumption (NB- we do allocate when "growing" content e.g. creating a window,.
   opening a tree node for the first time, etc. but a typical frame should not allocate anything).

 Designed for developers and content-creators, not the typical end-user! Some of the weaknesses includes:
 - Doesn't look fancy, doesn't animate.
 - Limited layout features, intricate layouts are typically crafted in code.


 END-USER GUIDE
 ==============

 - Double-click on title bar to collapse window.
 - Click upper right corner to close a window, available when 'bool* p_open' is passed to ImGui::Begin().
 - Click and drag on lower right corner to resize window (double-click to auto fit window to its contents).
 - Click and drag on any empty space to move window.
 - TAB/SHIFT+TAB to cycle through keyboard editable fields.
 - CTRL+Click on a slider or drag box to input value as text.
 - Use mouse wheel to scroll.
 - Text editor:
   - Hold SHIFT or use mouse to select text.
   - CTRL+Left/Right to word jump.
   - CTRL+Shift+Left/Right to select words.
   - CTRL+A our Double-Click to select all.
   - CTRL+X,CTRL+C,CTRL+V to use OS clipboard/
   - CTRL+Z,CTRL+Y to undo/redo.
   - ESCAPE to revert text to its original value.
   - You can apply arithmetic operators +,*,/ on numerical values. Use +- to subtract (because - would set a negative value!)
   - Controls are automatically adjusted for OSX to match standard OSX text editing operations.
 - General Keyboard controls: enable with ImGuiConfigFlags_NavEnableKeyboard.
 - General Gamepad controls: enable with ImGuiConfigFlags_NavEnableGamepad. See suggested mappings in imgui.h ImGuiNavInput_ + download PNG/PSD at http://goo.gl/9LgVZW


 PROGRAMMER GUIDE
 ================

 READ FIRST
 ----------
 - Remember to read the FAQ (https://www.dearimgui.org/faq)
 - Your code creates the UI, if your code doesn't run the UI is gone! The UI can be highly dynamic, there are no construction
   or destruction steps, less superfluous data retention on your side, less state duplication, less state synchronization, less bugs.
 - Call and read ImGui::ShowDemoWindow() for demo code demonstrating most features.
 - The library is designed to be built from sources. Avoid pre-compiled binaries and packaged versions. See imconfig.h to configure your build.
 - Dear ImGui is an implementation of the IMGUI paradigm (immediate-mode graphical user interface, a term coined by Casey Muratori).
   You can learn about IMGUI principles at http://www.johno.se/book/imgui.html, http://mollyrocket.com/861 & more links docs/README.md.
 - Dear ImGui is a "single pass" rasterizing implementation of the IMGUI paradigm, aimed at ease of use and high-performances.
   For every application frame your UI code will be called only once. This is in contrast to e.g. Unity's own implementation of an IMGUI,
   where the UI code is called multiple times ("multiple passes") from a single entry point. There are pros and cons to both approaches.
 - Our origin are on the top-left. In axis aligned bounding boxes, Min = top-left, Max = bottom-right.
 - This codebase is also optimized to yield decent performances with typical "Debug" builds settings.
 - Please make sure you have asserts enabled (IM_ASSERT redirects to assert() by default, but can be redirected).
   If you get an assert, read the messages and comments around the assert.
 - C++: this is a very C-ish codebase: we don't rely on C++11, we don't include any C++ headers, and ImGui:: is a namespace.
 - C++: ImVec2/ImVec4 do not expose math operators by default, because it is expected that you use your own math types.
   See FAQ "How can I use my own math types instead of ImVec2/ImVec4?" for details about setting up imconfig.h for that.
   However, imgui_internal.h can optionally export math operators for ImVec2/ImVec4, which we use in this codebase.
 - C++: pay attention that ImVector<> manipulates plain-old-data and does not honor construction/destruction (avoid using it in your code!).

 HOW TO UPDATE TO A NEWER VERSION OF DEAR IMGUI
 ----------------------------------------------
 - Overwrite all the sources files except for imconfig.h (if you have made modification to your copy of imconfig.h)
 - Or maintain your own branch where you have imconfig.h modified.
 - Read the "API BREAKING CHANGES" section (below). This is where we list occasional API breaking changes.
   If a function/type has been renamed / or marked obsolete, try to fix the name in your code before it is permanently removed
   from the public API. If you have a problem with a missing function/symbols, search for its name in the code, there will
   likely be a comment about it. Please report any issue to the GitHub page!
 - Try to keep your copy of dear imgui reasonably up to date.

 GETTING STARTED WITH INTEGRATING DEAR IMGUI IN YOUR CODE/ENGINE
 ---------------------------------------------------------------
 - Run and study the examples and demo in imgui_demo.cpp to get acquainted with the library.
 - In the majority of cases you should be able to use unmodified back-ends files available in the examples/ folder.
 - Add the Dear ImGui source files to your projects or using your preferred build system.
   It is recommended you build and statically link the .cpp files as part of your project and NOT as shared library (DLL).
 - You can later customize the imconfig.h file to tweak some compile-time behavior, such as integrating Dear ImGui types with your own maths types.
 - When using Dear ImGui, your programming IDE is your friend: follow the declaration of variables, functions and types to find comments about them.
 - Dear ImGui never touches or knows about your GPU state. The only function that knows about GPU is the draw function that you provide.
   Effectively it means you can create widgets at any time in your code, regardless of considerations of being in "update" vs "render"
   phases of your own application. All rendering information are stored into command-lists that you will retrieve after calling ImGui::Render().
 - Refer to the bindings and demo applications in the examples/ folder for instruction on how to setup your code.
 - If you are running over a standard OS with a common graphics API, you should be able to use unmodified imgui_impl_*** files from the examples/ folder.

 HOW A SIMPLE APPLICATION MAY LOOK LIKE
 --------------------------------------
 EXHIBIT 1: USING THE EXAMPLE BINDINGS (imgui_impl_XXX.cpp files from the examples/ folder).

     // Application init: create a dear imgui context, setup some options, load fonts
     ImGui::CreateContext();
     ImGuiIO& io = ImGui::GetIO();
     // TODO: Set optional io.ConfigFlags values, e.g. 'io.ConfigFlags |= ImGuiConfigFlags_NavEnableKeyboard' to enable keyboard controls.
     // TODO: Fill optional fields of the io structure later.
     // TODO: Load TTF/OTF fonts if you don't want to use the default font.

     // Initialize helper Platform and Renderer bindings (here we are using imgui_impl_win32.cpp and imgui_impl_dx11.cpp)
     ImGui_ImplWin32_Init(hwnd);
     ImGui_ImplDX11_Init(g_pd3dDevice, g_pd3dDeviceContext);

     // Application main loop
     while (true)
     {
         // Feed inputs to dear imgui, start new frame
         ImGui_ImplDX11_NewFrame();
         ImGui_ImplWin32_NewFrame();
         ImGui::NewFrame();

         // Any application code here
         ImGui::Text("Hello, world!");

         // Render dear imgui into screen
         ImGui::Render();
         ImGui_ImplDX11_RenderDrawData(ImGui::GetDrawData());
         g_pSwapChain->Present(1, 0);
     }

     // Shutdown
     ImGui_ImplDX11_Shutdown();
     ImGui_ImplWin32_Shutdown();
     ImGui::DestroyContext();

 EXHIBIT 2: IMPLEMENTING CUSTOM BINDING / CUSTOM ENGINE

     // Application init: create a dear imgui context, setup some options, load fonts
     ImGui::CreateContext();
     ImGuiIO& io = ImGui::GetIO();
     // TODO: Set optional io.ConfigFlags values, e.g. 'io.ConfigFlags |= ImGuiConfigFlags_NavEnableKeyboard' to enable keyboard controls.
     // TODO: Fill optional fields of the io structure later.
     // TODO: Load TTF/OTF fonts if you don't want to use the default font.

     // Build and load the texture atlas into a texture
     // (In the examples/ app this is usually done within the ImGui_ImplXXX_Init() function from one of the demo Renderer)
     int width, height;
     unsigned char* pixels = NULL;
     io.Fonts->GetTexDataAsRGBA32(&pixels, &width, &height);

     // At this point you've got the texture data and you need to upload that your your graphic system:
     // After we have created the texture, store its pointer/identifier (_in whichever format your engine uses_) in 'io.Fonts->TexID'.
     // This will be passed back to your via the renderer. Basically ImTextureID == void*. Read FAQ for details about ImTextureID.
     MyTexture* texture = MyEngine::CreateTextureFromMemoryPixels(pixels, width, height, TEXTURE_TYPE_RGBA32)
     io.Fonts->TexID = (void*)texture;

     // Application main loop
     while (true)
     {
        // Setup low-level inputs, e.g. on Win32: calling GetKeyboardState(), or write to those fields from your Windows message handlers, etc.
        // (In the examples/ app this is usually done within the ImGui_ImplXXX_NewFrame() function from one of the demo Platform bindings)
        io.DeltaTime = 1.0f/60.0f;              // set the time elapsed since the previous frame (in seconds)
        io.DisplaySize.x = 1920.0f;             // set the current display width
        io.DisplaySize.y = 1280.0f;             // set the current display height here
        io.MousePos = my_mouse_pos;             // set the mouse position
        io.MouseDown[0] = my_mouse_buttons[0];  // set the mouse button states
        io.MouseDown[1] = my_mouse_buttons[1];

        // Call NewFrame(), after this point you can use ImGui::* functions anytime
        // (So you want to try calling NewFrame() as early as you can in your mainloop to be able to use Dear ImGui everywhere)
        ImGui::NewFrame();

        // Most of your application code here
        ImGui::Text("Hello, world!");
        MyGameUpdate(); // may use any Dear ImGui functions, e.g. ImGui::Begin("My window"); ImGui::Text("Hello, world!"); ImGui::End();
        MyGameRender(); // may use any Dear ImGui functions as well!

        // Render dear imgui, swap buffers
        // (You want to try calling EndFrame/Render as late as you can, to be able to use Dear ImGui in your own game rendering code)
        ImGui::EndFrame();
        ImGui::Render();
        ImDrawData* draw_data = ImGui::GetDrawData();
        MyImGuiRenderFunction(draw_data);
        SwapBuffers();
     }

     // Shutdown
     ImGui::DestroyContext();

 HOW A SIMPLE RENDERING FUNCTION MAY LOOK LIKE
 ---------------------------------------------
    void void MyImGuiRenderFunction(ImDrawData* draw_data)
    {
       // TODO: Setup render state: alpha-blending enabled, no face culling, no depth testing, scissor enabled
       // TODO: Setup viewport covering draw_data->DisplayPos to draw_data->DisplayPos + draw_data->DisplaySize
       // TODO: Setup orthographic projection matrix cover draw_data->DisplayPos to draw_data->DisplayPos + draw_data->DisplaySize
       // TODO: Setup shader: vertex { float2 pos, float2 uv, u32 color }, fragment shader sample color from 1 texture, multiply by vertex color.
       for (int n = 0; n < draw_data->CmdListsCount; n++)
       {
          const ImDrawList* cmd_list = draw_data->CmdLists[n];
          const ImDrawVert* vtx_buffer = cmd_list->VtxBuffer.Data;  // vertex buffer generated by Dear ImGui
          const ImDrawIdx* idx_buffer = cmd_list->IdxBuffer.Data;   // index buffer generated by Dear ImGui
          for (int cmd_i = 0; cmd_i < cmd_list->CmdBuffer.Size; cmd_i++)
          {
             const ImDrawCmd* pcmd = &cmd_list->CmdBuffer[cmd_i];
             if (pcmd->UserCallback)
             {
                 pcmd->UserCallback(cmd_list, pcmd);
             }
             else
             {
                 // The texture for the draw call is specified by pcmd->TextureId.
                 // The vast majority of draw calls will use the Dear ImGui texture atlas, which value you have set yourself during initialization.
                 MyEngineBindTexture((MyTexture*)pcmd->TextureId);

                 // We are using scissoring to clip some objects. All low-level graphics API should supports it.
                 // - If your engine doesn't support scissoring yet, you may ignore this at first. You will get some small glitches
                 //   (some elements visible outside their bounds) but you can fix that once everything else works!
                 // - Clipping coordinates are provided in imgui coordinates space (from draw_data->DisplayPos to draw_data->DisplayPos + draw_data->DisplaySize)
                 //   In a single viewport application, draw_data->DisplayPos will always be (0,0) and draw_data->DisplaySize will always be == io.DisplaySize.
                 //   However, in the interest of supporting multi-viewport applications in the future (see 'viewport' branch on github),
                 //   always subtract draw_data->DisplayPos from clipping bounds to convert them to your viewport space.
                 // - Note that pcmd->ClipRect contains Min+Max bounds. Some graphics API may use Min+Max, other may use Min+Size (size being Max-Min)
                 ImVec2 pos = draw_data->DisplayPos;
                 MyEngineScissor((int)(pcmd->ClipRect.x - pos.x), (int)(pcmd->ClipRect.y - pos.y), (int)(pcmd->ClipRect.z - pos.x), (int)(pcmd->ClipRect.w - pos.y));

                 // Render 'pcmd->ElemCount/3' indexed triangles.
                 // By default the indices ImDrawIdx are 16-bit, you can change them to 32-bit in imconfig.h if your engine doesn't support 16-bit indices.
                 MyEngineDrawIndexedTriangles(pcmd->ElemCount, sizeof(ImDrawIdx) == 2 ? GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT : GL_UNSIGNED_INT, idx_buffer, vtx_buffer);
             }
             idx_buffer += pcmd->ElemCount;
          }
       }
    }

 - The examples/ folders contains many actual implementation of the pseudo-codes above.
 - When calling NewFrame(), the 'io.WantCaptureMouse', 'io.WantCaptureKeyboard' and 'io.WantTextInput' flags are updated.
   They tell you if Dear ImGui intends to use your inputs. When a flag is set you want to hide the corresponding inputs from the
   rest of your application. In every cases you need to pass on the inputs to Dear ImGui.
 - Refer to the FAQ for more information. Amusingly, it is called a FAQ because people frequently run into the same issues!

 USING GAMEPAD/KEYBOARD NAVIGATION CONTROLS
 ------------------------------------------
 - The gamepad/keyboard navigation is fairly functional and keeps being improved.
 - Gamepad support is particularly useful to use Dear ImGui on a console system (e.g. PS4, Switch, XB1) without a mouse!
 - You can ask questions and report issues at https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/issues/787
 - The initial focus was to support game controllers, but keyboard is becoming increasingly and decently usable.
 - Keyboard:
    - Set io.ConfigFlags |= ImGuiConfigFlags_NavEnableKeyboard to enable.
      NewFrame() will automatically fill io.NavInputs[] based on your io.KeysDown[] + io.KeyMap[] arrays.
    - When keyboard navigation is active (io.NavActive + ImGuiConfigFlags_NavEnableKeyboard), the io.WantCaptureKeyboard flag
      will be set. For more advanced uses, you may want to read from:
       - io.NavActive: true when a window is focused and it doesn't have the ImGuiWindowFlags_NoNavInputs flag set.
       - io.NavVisible: true when the navigation cursor is visible (and usually goes false when mouse is used).
       - or query focus information with e.g. IsWindowFocused(ImGuiFocusedFlags_AnyWindow), IsItemFocused() etc. functions.
      Please reach out if you think the game vs navigation input sharing could be improved.
 - Gamepad:
    - Set io.ConfigFlags |= ImGuiConfigFlags_NavEnableGamepad to enable.
    - Backend: Set io.BackendFlags |= ImGuiBackendFlags_HasGamepad + fill the io.NavInputs[] fields before calling NewFrame().
      Note that io.NavInputs[] is cleared by EndFrame().
    - See 'enum ImGuiNavInput_' in imgui.h for a description of inputs. For each entry of io.NavInputs[], set the following values:
         0.0f= not held. 1.0f= fully held. Pass intermediate 0.0f..1.0f values for analog triggers/sticks.
    - We uses a simple >0.0f test for activation testing, and won't attempt to test for a dead-zone.
      Your code will probably need to transform your raw inputs (such as e.g. remapping your 0.2..0.9 raw input range to 0.0..1.0 imgui range, etc.).
    - You can download PNG/PSD files depicting the gamepad controls for common controllers at: http://goo.gl/9LgVZW.
    - If you need to share inputs between your game and the imgui parts, the easiest approach is to go all-or-nothing, with a buttons combo
      to toggle the target. Please reach out if you think the game vs navigation input sharing could be improved.
 - Mouse:
    - PS4 users: Consider emulating a mouse cursor with DualShock4 touch pad or a spare analog stick as a mouse-emulation fallback.
    - Consoles/Tablet/Phone users: Consider using a Synergy 1.x server (on your PC) + uSynergy.c (on your console/tablet/phone app) to share your PC mouse/keyboard.
    - On a TV/console system where readability may be lower or mouse inputs may be awkward, you may want to set the ImGuiConfigFlags_NavEnableSetMousePos flag.
      Enabling ImGuiConfigFlags_NavEnableSetMousePos + ImGuiBackendFlags_HasSetMousePos instructs dear imgui to move your mouse cursor along with navigation movements.
      When enabled, the NewFrame() function may alter 'io.MousePos' and set 'io.WantSetMousePos' to notify you that it wants the mouse cursor to be moved.
      When that happens your back-end NEEDS to move the OS or underlying mouse cursor on the next frame. Some of the binding in examples/ do that.
      (If you set the NavEnableSetMousePos flag but don't honor 'io.WantSetMousePos' properly, imgui will misbehave as it will see your mouse as moving back and forth!)
      (In a setup when you may not have easy control over the mouse cursor, e.g. uSynergy.c doesn't expose moving remote mouse cursor, you may want
       to set a boolean to ignore your other external mouse positions until the external source is moved again.)


 API BREAKING CHANGES
 ====================

 Occasionally introducing changes that are breaking the API. We try to make the breakage minor and easy to fix.
 Below is a change-log of API breaking changes only. If you are using one of the functions listed, expect to have to fix some code.
 When you are not sure about a old symbol or function name, try using the Search/Find function of your IDE to look for comments or references in all imgui files.
 You can read releases logs https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/releases for more details.

 - 2020/01/22 (1.75) - ImDrawList::AddCircle()/AddCircleFilled() functions don't accept negative radius any more.
 - 2019/12/17 (1.75) - made Columns() limited to 64 columns by asserting above that limit. While the current code technically supports it, future code may not so we're putting the restriction ahead.
 - 2019/12/13 (1.75) - [imgui_internal.h] changed ImRect() default constructor initializes all fields to 0.0f instead of (FLT_MAX,FLT_MAX,-FLT_MAX,-FLT_MAX). If you used ImRect::Add() to create bounding boxes by adding multiple points into it, you may need to fix your initial value.
 - 2019/12/08 (1.75) - removed redirecting functions/enums that were marked obsolete in 1.53 (December 2017):
                       - ShowTestWindow()                    -> use ShowDemoWindow()
                       - IsRootWindowFocused()               -> use IsWindowFocused(ImGuiFocusedFlags_RootWindow)
                       - IsRootWindowOrAnyChildFocused()     -> use IsWindowFocused(ImGuiFocusedFlags_RootAndChildWindows)
                       - SetNextWindowContentWidth(w)        -> use SetNextWindowContentSize(ImVec2(w, 0.0f)
                       - GetItemsLineHeightWithSpacing()     -> use GetFrameHeightWithSpacing()
                       - ImGuiCol_ChildWindowBg              -> use ImGuiCol_ChildBg
                       - ImGuiStyleVar_ChildWindowRounding   -> use ImGuiStyleVar_ChildRounding
                       - ImGuiTreeNodeFlags_AllowOverlapMode -> use ImGuiTreeNodeFlags_AllowItemOverlap
                       - IMGUI_DISABLE_TEST_WINDOWS          -> use IMGUI_DISABLE_DEMO_WINDOWS
 - 2019/12/08 (1.75) - obsoleted calling ImDrawList::PrimReserve() with a negative count (which was the vaguely documented and rarely if ever used). Instead we added an explicit PrimUnreserve() API.
 - 2019/12/06 (1.75) - removed implicit default parameter to IsMouseDragging(int button = 0) to be consistent with other mouse functions (none of the other functions have it).
 - 2019/11/21 (1.74) - ImFontAtlas::AddCustomRectRegular() now requires an ID larger than 0x110000 (instead of 0x10000) to conform with supporting Unicode planes 1-16 in a future update. ID below 0x110000 will now assert.
 - 2019/11/19 (1.74) - renamed IMGUI_DISABLE_FORMAT_STRING_FUNCTIONS to IMGUI_DISABLE_DEFAULT_FORMAT_FUNCTIONS for consistency.
 - 2019/11/19 (1.74) - renamed IMGUI_DISABLE_MATH_FUNCTIONS to IMGUI_DISABLE_DEFAULT_MATH_FUNCTIONS for consistency.
 - 2019/10/22 (1.74) - removed redirecting functions/enums that were marked obsolete in 1.52 (October 2017):
                       - Begin() [old 5 args version]        -> use Begin() [3 args], use SetNextWindowSize() SetNextWindowBgAlpha() if needed
                       - IsRootWindowOrAnyChildHovered()     -> use IsWindowHovered(ImGuiHoveredFlags_RootAndChildWindows)
                       - AlignFirstTextHeightToWidgets()     -> use AlignTextToFramePadding()
                       - SetNextWindowPosCenter()            -> use SetNextWindowPos() with a pivot of (0.5f, 0.5f)
                       - ImFont::Glyph                       -> use ImFontGlyph
 - 2019/10/14 (1.74) - inputs: Fixed a miscalculation in the keyboard/mouse "typematic" repeat delay/rate calculation, used by keys and e.g. repeating mouse buttons as well as the GetKeyPressedAmount() function.
                       if you were using a non-default value for io.KeyRepeatRate (previous default was 0.250), you can add +io.KeyRepeatDelay to it to compensate for the fix.
                       The function was triggering on: 0.0 and (delay+rate*N) where (N>=1). Fixed formula responds to (N>=0). Effectively it made io.KeyRepeatRate behave like it was set to (io.KeyRepeatRate + io.KeyRepeatDelay).
                       If you never altered io.KeyRepeatRate nor used GetKeyPressedAmount() this won't affect you.
 - 2019/07/15 (1.72) - removed TreeAdvanceToLabelPos() which is rarely used and only does SetCursorPosX(GetCursorPosX() + GetTreeNodeToLabelSpacing()). Kept redirection function (will obsolete).
 - 2019/07/12 (1.72) - renamed ImFontAtlas::CustomRect to ImFontAtlasCustomRect. Kept redirection typedef (will obsolete).
 - 2019/06/14 (1.72) - removed redirecting functions/enums names that were marked obsolete in 1.51 (June 2017): ImGuiCol_Column*, ImGuiSetCond_*, IsItemHoveredRect(), IsPosHoveringAnyWindow(), IsMouseHoveringAnyWindow(), IsMouseHoveringWindow(), IMGUI_ONCE_UPON_A_FRAME. Grep this log for details and new names, or see how they were implemented until 1.71.
 - 2019/06/07 (1.71) - rendering of child window outer decorations (bg color, border, scrollbars) is now performed as part of the parent window. If you have
                       overlapping child windows in a same parent, and relied on their relative z-order to be mapped to their submission order, this will affect your rendering.
                       This optimization is disabled if the parent window has no visual output, because it appears to be the most common situation leading to the creation of overlapping child windows.
                       Please reach out if you are affected.
 - 2019/05/13 (1.71) - renamed SetNextTreeNodeOpen() to SetNextItemOpen(). Kept inline redirection function (will obsolete).
 - 2019/05/11 (1.71) - changed io.AddInputCharacter(unsigned short c) signature to io.AddInputCharacter(unsigned int c).
 - 2019/04/29 (1.70) - improved ImDrawList thick strokes (>1.0f) preserving correct thickness up to 90 degrees angles (e.g. rectangles). If you have custom rendering using thick lines, they will appear thicker now.
 - 2019/04/29 (1.70) - removed GetContentRegionAvailWidth(), use GetContentRegionAvail().x instead. Kept inline redirection function (will obsolete).
 - 2019/03/04 (1.69) - renamed GetOverlayDrawList() to GetForegroundDrawList(). Kept redirection function (will obsolete).
 - 2019/02/26 (1.69) - renamed ImGuiColorEditFlags_RGB/ImGuiColorEditFlags_HSV/ImGuiColorEditFlags_HEX to ImGuiColorEditFlags_DisplayRGB/ImGuiColorEditFlags_DisplayHSV/ImGuiColorEditFlags_DisplayHex. Kept redirection enums (will obsolete).
 - 2019/02/14 (1.68) - made it illegal/assert when io.DisplayTime == 0.0f (with an exception for the first frame). If for some reason your time step calculation gives you a zero value, replace it with a dummy small value!
 - 2019/02/01 (1.68) - removed io.DisplayVisibleMin/DisplayVisibleMax (which were marked obsolete and removed from viewport/docking branch already).
 - 2019/01/06 (1.67) - renamed io.InputCharacters[], marked internal as was always intended. Please don't access directly, and use AddInputCharacter() instead!
 - 2019/01/06 (1.67) - renamed ImFontAtlas::GlyphRangesBuilder to ImFontGlyphRangesBuilder. Kept redirection typedef (will obsolete).
 - 2018/12/20 (1.67) - made it illegal to call Begin("") with an empty string. This somehow half-worked before but had various undesirable side-effects.
 - 2018/12/10 (1.67) - renamed io.ConfigResizeWindowsFromEdges to io.ConfigWindowsResizeFromEdges as we are doing a large pass on configuration flags.
 - 2018/10/12 (1.66) - renamed misc/stl/imgui_stl.* to misc/cpp/imgui_stdlib.* in prevision for other C++ helper files.
 - 2018/09/28 (1.66) - renamed SetScrollHere() to SetScrollHereY(). Kept redirection function (will obsolete).
 - 2018/09/06 (1.65) - renamed stb_truetype.h to imstb_truetype.h, stb_textedit.h to imstb_textedit.h, and stb_rect_pack.h to imstb_rectpack.h.
                       If you were conveniently using the imgui copy of those STB headers in your project you will have to update your include paths.
 - 2018/09/05 (1.65) - renamed io.OptCursorBlink/io.ConfigCursorBlink to io.ConfigInputTextCursorBlink. (#1427)
 - 2018/08/31 (1.64) - added imgui_widgets.cpp file, extracted and moved widgets code out of imgui.cpp into imgui_widgets.cpp. Re-ordered some of the code remaining in imgui.cpp.
                       NONE OF THE FUNCTIONS HAVE CHANGED. THE CODE IS SEMANTICALLY 100% IDENTICAL, BUT _EVERY_ FUNCTION HAS BEEN MOVED.
                       Because of this, any local modifications to imgui.cpp will likely conflict when you update. Read docs/CHANGELOG.txt for suggestions.
 - 2018/08/22 (1.63) - renamed IsItemDeactivatedAfterChange() to IsItemDeactivatedAfterEdit() for consistency with new IsItemEdited() API. Kept redirection function (will obsolete soonish as IsItemDeactivatedAfterChange() is very recent).
 - 2018/08/21 (1.63) - renamed ImGuiTextEditCallback to ImGuiInputTextCallback, ImGuiTextEditCallbackData to ImGuiInputTextCallbackData for consistency. Kept redirection types (will obsolete).
 - 2018/08/21 (1.63) - removed ImGuiInputTextCallbackData::ReadOnly since it is a duplication of (ImGuiInputTextCallbackData::Flags & ImGuiInputTextFlags_ReadOnly).
 - 2018/08/01 (1.63) - removed per-window ImGuiWindowFlags_ResizeFromAnySide beta flag in favor of a global io.ConfigResizeWindowsFromEdges [update 1.67 renamed to ConfigWindowsResizeFromEdges] to enable the feature.
 - 2018/08/01 (1.63) - renamed io.OptCursorBlink to io.ConfigCursorBlink [-> io.ConfigInputTextCursorBlink in 1.65], io.OptMacOSXBehaviors to ConfigMacOSXBehaviors for consistency.
 - 2018/07/22 (1.63) - changed ImGui::GetTime() return value from float to double to avoid accumulating floating point imprecisions over time.
 - 2018/07/08 (1.63) - style: renamed ImGuiCol_ModalWindowDarkening to ImGuiCol_ModalWindowDimBg for consistency with other features. Kept redirection enum (will obsolete).
 - 2018/06/08 (1.62) - examples: the imgui_impl_xxx files have been split to separate platform (Win32, Glfw, SDL2, etc.) from renderer (DX11, OpenGL, Vulkan,  etc.).
                       old bindings will still work as is, however prefer using the separated bindings as they will be updated to support multi-viewports.
                       when adopting new bindings follow the main.cpp code of your preferred examples/ folder to know which functions to call.
                       in particular, note that old bindings called ImGui::NewFrame() at the end of their ImGui_ImplXXXX_NewFrame() function.
 - 2018/06/06 (1.62) - renamed GetGlyphRangesChinese() to GetGlyphRangesChineseFull() to distinguish other variants and discourage using the full set.
 - 2018/06/06 (1.62) - TreeNodeEx()/TreeNodeBehavior(): the ImGuiTreeNodeFlags_CollapsingHeader helper now include the ImGuiTreeNodeFlags_NoTreePushOnOpen flag. See Changelog for details.
 - 2018/05/03 (1.61) - DragInt(): the default compile-time format string has been changed from "%.0f" to "%d", as we are not using integers internally any more.
                       If you used DragInt() with custom format strings, make sure you change them to use %d or an integer-compatible format.
                       To honor backward-compatibility, the DragInt() code will currently parse and modify format strings to replace %*f with %d, giving time to users to upgrade their code.
                       If you have IMGUI_DISABLE_OBSOLETE_FUNCTIONS enabled, the code will instead assert! You may run a reg-exp search on your codebase for e.g. "DragInt.*%f" to help you find them.
 - 2018/04/28 (1.61) - obsoleted InputFloat() functions taking an optional "int decimal_precision" in favor of an equivalent and more flexible "const char* format",
                       consistent with other functions. Kept redirection functions (will obsolete).
 - 2018/04/09 (1.61) - IM_DELETE() helper function added in 1.60 doesn't clear the input _pointer_ reference, more consistent with expectation and allows passing r-value.
 - 2018/03/20 (1.60) - renamed io.WantMoveMouse to io.WantSetMousePos for consistency and ease of understanding (was added in 1.52, _not_ used by core and only honored by some binding ahead of merging the Nav branch).
 - 2018/03/12 (1.60) - removed ImGuiCol_CloseButton, ImGuiCol_CloseButtonActive, ImGuiCol_CloseButtonHovered as the closing cross uses regular button colors now.
 - 2018/03/08 (1.60) - changed ImFont::DisplayOffset.y to default to 0 instead of +1. Fixed rounding of Ascent/Descent to match TrueType renderer. If you were adding or subtracting to ImFont::DisplayOffset check if your fonts are correctly aligned vertically.
 - 2018/03/03 (1.60) - renamed ImGuiStyleVar_Count_ to ImGuiStyleVar_COUNT and ImGuiMouseCursor_Count_ to ImGuiMouseCursor_COUNT for consistency with other public enums.
 - 2018/02/18 (1.60) - BeginDragDropSource(): temporarily removed the optional mouse_button=0 parameter because it is not really usable in many situations at the moment.
 - 2018/02/16 (1.60) - obsoleted the io.RenderDrawListsFn callback, you can call your graphics engine render function after ImGui::Render(). Use ImGui::GetDrawData() to retrieve the ImDrawData* to display.
 - 2018/02/07 (1.60) - reorganized context handling to be more explicit,
                       - YOU NOW NEED TO CALL ImGui::CreateContext() AT THE BEGINNING OF YOUR APP, AND CALL ImGui::DestroyContext() AT THE END.
                       - removed Shutdown() function, as DestroyContext() serve this purpose.
                       - you may pass a ImFontAtlas* pointer to CreateContext() to share a font atlas between contexts. Otherwise CreateContext() will create its own font atlas instance.
                       - removed allocator parameters from CreateContext(), they are now setup with SetAllocatorFunctions(), and shared by all contexts.
                       - removed the default global context and font atlas instance, which were confusing for users of DLL reloading and users of multiple contexts.
 - 2018/01/31 (1.60) - moved sample TTF files from extra_fonts/ to misc/fonts/. If you loaded files directly from the imgui repo you may need to update your paths.
 - 2018/01/11 (1.60) - obsoleted IsAnyWindowHovered() in favor of IsWindowHovered(ImGuiHoveredFlags_AnyWindow). Kept redirection function (will obsolete).
 - 2018/01/11 (1.60) - obsoleted IsAnyWindowFocused() in favor of IsWindowFocused(ImGuiFocusedFlags_AnyWindow). Kept redirection function (will obsolete).
 - 2018/01/03 (1.60) - renamed ImGuiSizeConstraintCallback to ImGuiSizeCallback, ImGuiSizeConstraintCallbackData to ImGuiSizeCallbackData.
 - 2017/12/29 (1.60) - removed CalcItemRectClosestPoint() which was weird and not really used by anyone except demo code. If you need it it's easy to replicate on your side.
 - 2017/12/24 (1.53) - renamed the emblematic ShowTestWindow() function to ShowDemoWindow(). Kept redirection function (will obsolete).
 - 2017/12/21 (1.53) - ImDrawList: renamed style.AntiAliasedShapes to style.AntiAliasedFill for consistency and as a way to explicitly break code that manipulate those flag at runtime. You can now manipulate ImDrawList::Flags
 - 2017/12/21 (1.53) - ImDrawList: removed 'bool anti_aliased = true' final parameter of ImDrawList::AddPolyline() and ImDrawList::AddConvexPolyFilled(). Prefer manipulating ImDrawList::Flags if you need to toggle them during the frame.
 - 2017/12/14 (1.53) - using the ImGuiWindowFlags_NoScrollWithMouse flag on a child window forwards the mouse wheel event to the parent window, unless either ImGuiWindowFlags_NoInputs or ImGuiWindowFlags_NoScrollbar are also set.
 - 2017/12/13 (1.53) - renamed GetItemsLineHeightWithSpacing() to GetFrameHeightWithSpacing(). Kept redirection function (will obsolete).
 - 2017/12/13 (1.53) - obsoleted IsRootWindowFocused() in favor of using IsWindowFocused(ImGuiFocusedFlags_RootWindow). Kept redirection function (will obsolete).
                     - obsoleted IsRootWindowOrAnyChildFocused() in favor of using IsWindowFocused(ImGuiFocusedFlags_RootAndChildWindows). Kept redirection function (will obsolete).
 - 2017/12/12 (1.53) - renamed ImGuiTreeNodeFlags_AllowOverlapMode to ImGuiTreeNodeFlags_AllowItemOverlap. Kept redirection enum (will obsolete).
 - 2017/12/10 (1.53) - removed SetNextWindowContentWidth(), prefer using SetNextWindowContentSize(). Kept redirection function (will obsolete).
 - 2017/11/27 (1.53) - renamed ImGuiTextBuffer::append() helper to appendf(), appendv() to appendfv(). If you copied the 'Log' demo in your code, it uses appendv() so that needs to be renamed.
 - 2017/11/18 (1.53) - Style, Begin: removed ImGuiWindowFlags_ShowBorders window flag. Borders are now fully set up in the ImGuiStyle structure (see e.g. style.FrameBorderSize, style.WindowBorderSize). Use ImGui::ShowStyleEditor() to look them up.
                       Please note that the style system will keep evolving (hopefully stabilizing in Q1 2018), and so custom styles will probably subtly break over time. It is recommended you use the StyleColorsClassic(), StyleColorsDark(), StyleColorsLight() functions.
 - 2017/11/18 (1.53) - Style: removed ImGuiCol_ComboBg in favor of combo boxes using ImGuiCol_PopupBg for consistency.
 - 2017/11/18 (1.53) - Style: renamed ImGuiCol_ChildWindowBg to ImGuiCol_ChildBg.
 - 2017/11/18 (1.53) - Style: renamed style.ChildWindowRounding to style.ChildRounding, ImGuiStyleVar_ChildWindowRounding to ImGuiStyleVar_ChildRounding.
 - 2017/11/02 (1.53) - obsoleted IsRootWindowOrAnyChildHovered() in favor of using IsWindowHovered(ImGuiHoveredFlags_RootAndChildWindows);
 - 2017/10/24 (1.52) - renamed IMGUI_DISABLE_WIN32_DEFAULT_CLIPBOARD_FUNCS/IMGUI_DISABLE_WIN32_DEFAULT_IME_FUNCS to IMGUI_DISABLE_WIN32_DEFAULT_CLIPBOARD_FUNCTIONS/IMGUI_DISABLE_WIN32_DEFAULT_IME_FUNCTIONS for consistency.
 - 2017/10/20 (1.52) - changed IsWindowHovered() default parameters behavior to return false if an item is active in another window (e.g. click-dragging item from another window to this window). You can use the newly introduced IsWindowHovered() flags to requests this specific behavior if you need it.
 - 2017/10/20 (1.52) - marked IsItemHoveredRect()/IsMouseHoveringWindow() as obsolete, in favor of using the newly introduced flags for IsItemHovered() and IsWindowHovered(). See https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/issues/1382 for details.
                       removed the IsItemRectHovered()/IsWindowRectHovered() names introduced in 1.51 since they were merely more consistent names for the two functions we are now obsoleting.
                         IsItemHoveredRect()        --> IsItemHovered(ImGuiHoveredFlags_RectOnly)
                         IsMouseHoveringAnyWindow() --> IsWindowHovered(ImGuiHoveredFlags_AnyWindow)
                         IsMouseHoveringWindow()    --> IsWindowHovered(ImGuiHoveredFlags_AllowWhenBlockedByPopup | ImGuiHoveredFlags_AllowWhenBlockedByActiveItem) [weird, old behavior]
 - 2017/10/17 (1.52) - marked the old 5-parameters version of Begin() as obsolete (still available). Use SetNextWindowSize()+Begin() instead!
 - 2017/10/11 (1.52) - renamed AlignFirstTextHeightToWidgets() to AlignTextToFramePadding(). Kept inline redirection function (will obsolete).
 - 2017/09/26 (1.52) - renamed ImFont::Glyph to ImFontGlyph. Kept redirection typedef (will obsolete).
 - 2017/09/25 (1.52) - removed SetNextWindowPosCenter() because SetNextWindowPos() now has the optional pivot information to do the same and more. Kept redirection function (will obsolete).
 - 2017/08/25 (1.52) - io.MousePos needs to be set to ImVec2(-FLT_MAX,-FLT_MAX) when mouse is unavailable/missing. Previously ImVec2(-1,-1) was enough but we now accept negative mouse coordinates. In your binding if you need to support unavailable mouse, make sure to replace "io.MousePos = ImVec2(-1,-1)" with "io.MousePos = ImVec2(-FLT_MAX,-FLT_MAX)".
 - 2017/08/22 (1.51) - renamed IsItemHoveredRect() to IsItemRectHovered(). Kept inline redirection function (will obsolete). -> (1.52) use IsItemHovered(ImGuiHoveredFlags_RectOnly)!
                     - renamed IsMouseHoveringAnyWindow() to IsAnyWindowHovered() for consistency. Kept inline redirection function (will obsolete).
                     - renamed IsMouseHoveringWindow() to IsWindowRectHovered() for consistency. Kept inline redirection function (will obsolete).
 - 2017/08/20 (1.51) - renamed GetStyleColName() to GetStyleColorName() for consistency.
 - 2017/08/20 (1.51) - added PushStyleColor(ImGuiCol idx, ImU32 col) overload, which _might_ cause an "ambiguous call" compilation error if you are using ImColor() with implicit cast. Cast to ImU32 or ImVec4 explicily to fix.
 - 2017/08/15 (1.51) - marked the weird IMGUI_ONCE_UPON_A_FRAME helper macro as obsolete. prefer using the more explicit ImGuiOnceUponAFrame type.
 - 2017/08/15 (1.51) - changed parameter order for BeginPopupContextWindow() from (const char*,int buttons,bool also_over_items) to (const char*,int buttons,bool also_over_items). Note that most calls relied on default parameters completely.
 - 2017/08/13 (1.51) - renamed ImGuiCol_Column to ImGuiCol_Separator, ImGuiCol_ColumnHovered to ImGuiCol_SeparatorHovered, ImGuiCol_ColumnActive to ImGuiCol_SeparatorActive. Kept redirection enums (will obsolete).
 - 2017/08/11 (1.51) - renamed ImGuiSetCond_Always to ImGuiCond_Always, ImGuiSetCond_Once to ImGuiCond_Once, ImGuiSetCond_FirstUseEver to ImGuiCond_FirstUseEver, ImGuiSetCond_Appearing to ImGuiCond_Appearing. Kept redirection enums (will obsolete).
 - 2017/08/09 (1.51) - removed ValueColor() helpers, they are equivalent to calling Text(label) + SameLine() + ColorButton().
 - 2017/08/08 (1.51) - removed ColorEditMode() and ImGuiColorEditMode in favor of ImGuiColorEditFlags and parameters to the various Color*() functions. The SetColorEditOptions() allows to initialize default but the user can still change them with right-click context menu.
                     - changed prototype of 'ColorEdit4(const char* label, float col[4], bool show_alpha = true)' to 'ColorEdit4(const char* label, float col[4], ImGuiColorEditFlags flags = 0)', where passing flags = 0x01 is a safe no-op (hello dodgy backward compatibility!). - check and run the demo window, under "Color/Picker Widgets", to understand the various new options.
                     - changed prototype of rarely used 'ColorButton(ImVec4 col, bool small_height = false, bool outline_border = true)' to 'ColorButton(const char* desc_id, ImVec4 col, ImGuiColorEditFlags flags = 0, ImVec2 size = ImVec2(0,0))'
 - 2017/07/20 (1.51) - removed IsPosHoveringAnyWindow(ImVec2), which was partly broken and misleading. ASSERT + redirect user to io.WantCaptureMouse
 - 2017/05/26 (1.50) - removed ImFontConfig::MergeGlyphCenterV in favor of a more multipurpose ImFontConfig::GlyphOffset.
 - 2017/05/01 (1.50) - renamed ImDrawList::PathFill() (rarely used directly) to ImDrawList::PathFillConvex() for clarity.
 - 2016/11/06 (1.50) - BeginChild(const char*) now applies the stack id to the provided label, consistently with other functions as it should always have been. It shouldn't affect you unless (extremely unlikely) you were appending multiple times to a same child from different locations of the stack id. If that's the case, generate an id with GetId() and use it instead of passing string to BeginChild().
 - 2016/10/15 (1.50) - avoid 'void* user_data' parameter to io.SetClipboardTextFn/io.GetClipboardTextFn pointers. We pass io.ClipboardUserData to it.
 - 2016/09/25 (1.50) - style.WindowTitleAlign is now a ImVec2 (ImGuiAlign enum was removed). set to (0.5f,0.5f) for horizontal+vertical centering, (0.0f,0.0f) for upper-left, etc.
 - 2016/07/30 (1.50) - SameLine(x) with x>0.0f is now relative to left of column/group if any, and not always to left of window. This was sort of always the intent and hopefully breakage should be minimal.
 - 2016/05/12 (1.49) - title bar (using ImGuiCol_TitleBg/ImGuiCol_TitleBgActive colors) isn't rendered over a window background (ImGuiCol_WindowBg color) anymore.
                       If your TitleBg/TitleBgActive alpha was 1.0f or you are using the default theme it will not affect you, otherwise if <1.0f you need tweak your custom theme to readjust for the fact that we don't draw a WindowBg background behind the title bar.
                       This helper function will convert an old TitleBg/TitleBgActive color into a new one with the same visual output, given the OLD color and the OLD WindowBg color:
                       ImVec4 ConvertTitleBgCol(const ImVec4& win_bg_col, const ImVec4& title_bg_col) { float new_a = 1.0f - ((1.0f - win_bg_col.w) * (1.0f - title_bg_col.w)), k = title_bg_col.w / new_a; return ImVec4((win_bg_col.x * win_bg_col.w + title_bg_col.x) * k, (win_bg_col.y * win_bg_col.w + title_bg_col.y) * k, (win_bg_col.z * win_bg_col.w + title_bg_col.z) * k, new_a); }
                       If this is confusing, pick the RGB value from title bar from an old screenshot and apply this as TitleBg/TitleBgActive. Or you may just create TitleBgActive from a tweaked TitleBg color.
 - 2016/05/07 (1.49) - removed confusing set of GetInternalState(), GetInternalStateSize(), SetInternalState() functions. Now using CreateContext(), DestroyContext(), GetCurrentContext(), SetCurrentContext().
 - 2016/05/02 (1.49) - renamed SetNextTreeNodeOpened() to SetNextTreeNodeOpen(), no redirection.
 - 2016/05/01 (1.49) - obsoleted old signature of CollapsingHeader(const char* label, const char* str_id = NULL, bool display_frame = true, bool default_open = false) as extra parameters were badly designed and rarely used. You can replace the "default_open = true" flag in new API with CollapsingHeader(label, ImGuiTreeNodeFlags_DefaultOpen).
 - 2016/04/26 (1.49) - changed ImDrawList::PushClipRect(ImVec4 rect) to ImDrawList::PushClipRect(Imvec2 min,ImVec2 max,bool intersect_with_current_clip_rect=false). Note that higher-level ImGui::PushClipRect() is preferable because it will clip at logic/widget level, whereas ImDrawList::PushClipRect() only affect your renderer.
 - 2016/04/03 (1.48) - removed style.WindowFillAlphaDefault setting which was redundant. Bake default BG alpha inside style.Colors[ImGuiCol_WindowBg] and all other Bg color values. (ref github issue #337).
 - 2016/04/03 (1.48) - renamed ImGuiCol_TooltipBg to ImGuiCol_PopupBg, used by popups/menus and tooltips. popups/menus were previously using ImGuiCol_WindowBg. (ref github issue #337)
 - 2016/03/21 (1.48) - renamed GetWindowFont() to GetFont(), GetWindowFontSize() to GetFontSize(). Kept inline redirection function (will obsolete).
 - 2016/03/02 (1.48) - InputText() completion/history/always callbacks: if you modify the text buffer manually (without using DeleteChars()/InsertChars() helper) you need to maintain the BufTextLen field. added an assert.
 - 2016/01/23 (1.48) - fixed not honoring exact width passed to PushItemWidth(), previously it would add extra FramePadding.x*2 over that width. if you had manual pixel-perfect alignment in place it might affect you.
 - 2015/12/27 (1.48) - fixed ImDrawList::AddRect() which used to render a rectangle 1 px too large on each axis.
 - 2015/12/04 (1.47) - renamed Color() helpers to ValueColor() - dangerously named, rarely used and probably to be made obsolete.
 - 2015/08/29 (1.45) - with the addition of horizontal scrollbar we made various fixes to inconsistencies with dealing with cursor position.
                       GetCursorPos()/SetCursorPos() functions now include the scrolled amount. It shouldn't affect the majority of users, but take note that SetCursorPosX(100.0f) puts you at +100 from the starting x position which may include scrolling, not at +100 from the window left side.
                       GetContentRegionMax()/GetWindowContentRegionMin()/GetWindowContentRegionMax() functions allow include the scrolled amount. Typically those were used in cases where no scrolling would happen so it may not be a problem, but watch out!
 - 2015/08/29 (1.45) - renamed style.ScrollbarWidth to style.ScrollbarSize
 - 2015/08/05 (1.44) - split imgui.cpp into extra files: imgui_demo.cpp imgui_draw.cpp imgui_internal.h that you need to add to your project.
 - 2015/07/18 (1.44) - fixed angles in ImDrawList::PathArcTo(), PathArcToFast() (introduced in 1.43) being off by an extra PI for no justifiable reason
 - 2015/07/14 (1.43) - add new ImFontAtlas::AddFont() API. For the old AddFont***, moved the 'font_no' parameter of ImFontAtlas::AddFont** functions to the ImFontConfig structure.
                       you need to render your textured triangles with bilinear filtering to benefit from sub-pixel positioning of text.
 - 2015/07/08 (1.43) - switched rendering data to use indexed rendering. this is saving a fair amount of CPU/GPU and enables us to get anti-aliasing for a marginal cost.
                       this necessary change will break your rendering function! the fix should be very easy. sorry for that :(
                     - if you are using a vanilla copy of one of the imgui_impl_XXXX.cpp provided in the example, you just need to update your copy and you can ignore the rest.
                     - the signature of the io.RenderDrawListsFn handler has changed!
                       old: ImGui_XXXX_RenderDrawLists(ImDrawList** const cmd_lists, int cmd_lists_count)
                       new: ImGui_XXXX_RenderDrawLists(ImDrawData* draw_data).
                         parameters: 'cmd_lists' becomes 'draw_data->CmdLists', 'cmd_lists_count' becomes 'draw_data->CmdListsCount'
                         ImDrawList: 'commands' becomes 'CmdBuffer', 'vtx_buffer' becomes 'VtxBuffer', 'IdxBuffer' is new.
                         ImDrawCmd:  'vtx_count' becomes 'ElemCount', 'clip_rect' becomes 'ClipRect', 'user_callback' becomes 'UserCallback', 'texture_id' becomes 'TextureId'.
                     - each ImDrawList now contains both a vertex buffer and an index buffer. For each command, render ElemCount/3 triangles using indices from the index buffer.
                     - if you REALLY cannot render indexed primitives, you can call the draw_data->DeIndexAllBuffers() method to de-index the buffers. This is slow and a waste of CPU/GPU. Prefer using indexed rendering!
                     - refer to code in the examples/ folder or ask on the GitHub if you are unsure of how to upgrade. please upgrade!
 - 2015/07/10 (1.43) - changed SameLine() parameters from int to float.
 - 2015/07/02 (1.42) - renamed SetScrollPosHere() to SetScrollFromCursorPos(). Kept inline redirection function (will obsolete).
 - 2015/07/02 (1.42) - renamed GetScrollPosY() to GetScrollY(). Necessary to reduce confusion along with other scrolling functions, because positions (e.g. cursor position) are not equivalent to scrolling amount.
 - 2015/06/14 (1.41) - changed ImageButton() default bg_col parameter from (0,0,0,1) (black) to (0,0,0,0) (transparent) - makes a difference when texture have transparence
 - 2015/06/14 (1.41) - changed Selectable() API from (label, selected, size) to (label, selected, flags, size). Size override should have been rarely be used. Sorry!
 - 2015/05/31 (1.40) - renamed GetWindowCollapsed() to IsWindowCollapsed() for consistency. Kept inline redirection function (will obsolete).
 - 2015/05/31 (1.40) - renamed IsRectClipped() to IsRectVisible() for consistency. Note that return value is opposite! Kept inline redirection function (will obsolete).
 - 2015/05/27 (1.40) - removed the third 'repeat_if_held' parameter from Button() - sorry! it was rarely used and inconsistent. Use PushButtonRepeat(true) / PopButtonRepeat() to enable repeat on desired buttons.
 - 2015/05/11 (1.40) - changed BeginPopup() API, takes a string identifier instead of a bool. ImGui needs to manage the open/closed state of popups. Call OpenPopup() to actually set the "open" state of a popup. BeginPopup() returns true if the popup is opened.
 - 2015/05/03 (1.40) - removed style.AutoFitPadding, using style.WindowPadding makes more sense (the default values were already the same).
 - 2015/04/13 (1.38) - renamed IsClipped() to IsRectClipped(). Kept inline redirection function until 1.50.
 - 2015/04/09 (1.38) - renamed ImDrawList::AddArc() to ImDrawList::AddArcFast() for compatibility with future API
 - 2015/04/03 (1.38) - removed ImGuiCol_CheckHovered, ImGuiCol_CheckActive, replaced with the more general ImGuiCol_FrameBgHovered, ImGuiCol_FrameBgActive.
 - 2014/04/03 (1.38) - removed support for passing -FLT_MAX..+FLT_MAX as the range for a SliderFloat(). Use DragFloat() or Inputfloat() instead.
 - 2015/03/17 (1.36) - renamed GetItemBoxMin()/GetItemBoxMax()/IsMouseHoveringBox() to GetItemRectMin()/GetItemRectMax()/IsMouseHoveringRect(). Kept inline redirection function until 1.50.
 - 2015/03/15 (1.36) - renamed style.TreeNodeSpacing to style.IndentSpacing, ImGuiStyleVar_TreeNodeSpacing to ImGuiStyleVar_IndentSpacing
 - 2015/03/13 (1.36) - renamed GetWindowIsFocused() to IsWindowFocused(). Kept inline redirection function until 1.50.
 - 2015/03/08 (1.35) - renamed style.ScrollBarWidth to style.ScrollbarWidth (casing)
 - 2015/02/27 (1.34) - renamed OpenNextNode(bool) to SetNextTreeNodeOpened(bool, ImGuiSetCond). Kept inline redirection function until 1.50.
 - 2015/02/27 (1.34) - renamed ImGuiSetCondition_*** to ImGuiSetCond_***, and _FirstUseThisSession becomes _Once.
 - 2015/02/11 (1.32) - changed text input callback ImGuiTextEditCallback return type from void-->int. reserved for future use, return 0 for now.
 - 2015/02/10 (1.32) - renamed GetItemWidth() to CalcItemWidth() to clarify its evolving behavior
 - 2015/02/08 (1.31) - renamed GetTextLineSpacing() to GetTextLineHeightWithSpacing()
 - 2015/02/01 (1.31) - removed IO.MemReallocFn (unused)
 - 2015/01/19 (1.30) - renamed ImGuiStorage::GetIntPtr()/GetFloatPtr() to GetIntRef()/GetIntRef() because Ptr was conflicting with actual pointer storage functions.
 - 2015/01/11 (1.30) - big font/image API change! now loads TTF file. allow for multiple fonts. no need for a PNG loader.
 - 2015/01/11 (1.30) - removed GetDefaultFontData(). uses io.Fonts->GetTextureData*() API to retrieve uncompressed pixels.
                       - old:  const void* png_data; unsigned int png_size; ImGui::GetDefaultFontData(NULL, NULL, &png_data, &png_size); [..Upload texture to GPU..];
                       - new:  unsigned char* pixels; int width, height; io.Fonts->GetTexDataAsRGBA32(&pixels, &width, &height); [..Upload texture to GPU..]; io.Fonts->TexId = YourTexIdentifier;
                       you now have more flexibility to load multiple TTF fonts and manage the texture buffer for internal needs. It is now recommended that you sample the font texture with bilinear interpolation.
 - 2015/01/11 (1.30) - added texture identifier in ImDrawCmd passed to your render function (we can now render images). make sure to set io.Fonts->TexID.
 - 2015/01/11 (1.30) - removed IO.PixelCenterOffset (unnecessary, can be handled in user projection matrix)
 - 2015/01/11 (1.30) - removed ImGui::IsItemFocused() in favor of ImGui::IsItemActive() which handles all widgets
 - 2014/12/10 (1.18) - removed SetNewWindowDefaultPos() in favor of new generic API SetNextWindowPos(pos, ImGuiSetCondition_FirstUseEver)

 - 2014/11/26 (1.17) - reworked syntax of IMGUI_ONCE_UPON_A_FRAME helper macro to increase compiler compatibility
 - 2014/11/07 (1.15) - renamed IsHovered() to IsItemHovered()
 - 2014/10/02 (1.14) - renamed IMGUI_INCLUDE_IMGUI_USER_CPP to IMGUI_INCLUDE_IMGUI_USER_INL and imgui_user.cpp to imgui_user.inl (more IDE friendly)
 - 2014/09/25 (1.13) - removed 'text_end' parameter from IO.SetClipboardTextFn (the string is now always zero-terminated for simplicity)
 - 2014/09/24 (1.12) - renamed SetFontScale() to SetWindowFontScale()
 - 2014/09/24 (1.12) - moved IM_MALLOC/IM_REALLOC/IM_FREE preprocessor defines to IO.MemAllocFn/IO.MemReallocFn/IO.MemFreeFn

 Q&A: Usage
 ----------

 Q: Why are multiple widgets reacting when I interact with a single one?
 Q: How can I have multiple widgets with the same label or with an empty label?
 A: A primer on labels and the ID Stack...

    Dear ImGui internally need to uniquely identify UI elements.
    Elements that are typically not clickable (such as calls to the Text functions) don't need an ID.
    Interactive widgets (such as calls to Button buttons) need a unique ID.
    Unique ID are used internally to track active widgets and occasionally associate state to widgets.
    Unique ID are implicitly built from the hash of multiple elements that identify the "path" to the UI element.

   - Unique ID are often derived from a string label:

       Button("OK");          // Label = "OK",     ID = hash of (..., "OK")
       Button("Cancel");      // Label = "Cancel", ID = hash of (..., "Cancel")

   - ID are uniquely scoped within windows, tree nodes, etc. which all pushes to the ID stack. Having
     two buttons labeled "OK" in different windows or different tree locations is fine.
     We used "..." above to signify whatever was already pushed to the ID stack previously:

       Begin("MyWindow");
       Button("OK");          // Label = "OK",     ID = hash of ("MyWindow", "OK")
       End();
       Begin("MyOtherWindow");
       Button("OK");          // Label = "OK",     ID = hash of ("MyOtherWindow", "OK")
       End();

   - If you have a same ID twice in the same location, you'll have a conflict:

       Button("OK");
       Button("OK");          // ID collision! Interacting with either button will trigger the first one.

     Fear not! this is easy to solve and there are many ways to solve it!

   - Solving ID conflict in a simple/local context:
     When passing a label you can optionally specify extra ID information within string itself.
     Use "##" to pass a complement to the ID that won't be visible to the end-user.
     This helps solving the simple collision cases when you know e.g. at compilation time which items
     are going to be created:

       Begin("MyWindow");
       Button("Play");        // Label = "Play",   ID = hash of ("MyWindow", "Play")
       Button("Play##foo1");  // Label = "Play",   ID = hash of ("MyWindow", "Play##foo1")  // Different from above
       Button("Play##foo2");  // Label = "Play",   ID = hash of ("MyWindow", "Play##foo2")  // Different from above
       End();

   - If you want to completely hide the label, but still need an ID:

       Checkbox("##On", &b);  // Label = "",       ID = hash of (..., "##On")   // No visible label, just a checkbox!

   - Occasionally/rarely you might want change a label while preserving a constant ID. This allows
     you to animate labels. For example you may want to include varying information in a window title bar,
     but windows are uniquely identified by their ID. Use "###" to pass a label that isn't part of ID:

       Button("Hello###ID");  // Label = "Hello",  ID = hash of (..., "###ID")
       Button("World###ID");  // Label = "World",  ID = hash of (..., "###ID")  // Same as above, even though the label looks different

       sprintf(buf, "My game (%f FPS)###MyGame", fps);
       Begin(buf);            // Variable title,   ID = hash of "MyGame"

   - Solving ID conflict in a more general manner:
     Use PushID() / PopID() to create scopes and manipulate the ID stack, as to avoid ID conflicts
     within the same window. This is the most convenient way of distinguishing ID when iterating and
     creating many UI elements programmatically.
     You can push a pointer, a string or an integer value into the ID stack.
     Remember that ID are formed from the concatenation of _everything_ pushed into the ID stack.
     At each level of the stack we store the seed used for items at this level of the ID stack.

     Begin("Window");
       for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++)
       {
         PushID(i);           // Push i to the id tack
         Button("Click");     // Label = "Click",  ID = hash of ("Window", i, "Click")
         PopID();
       }
       for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++)
       {
         MyObject* obj = Objects[i];
         PushID(obj);
         Button("Click");     // Label = "Click",  ID = hash of ("Window", obj pointer, "Click")
         PopID();
       }
       for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++)
       {
         MyObject* obj = Objects[i];
         PushID(obj->Name);
         Button("Click");     // Label = "Click",  ID = hash of ("Window", obj->Name, "Click")
         PopID();
       }
       End();

   - You can stack multiple prefixes into the ID stack:

       Button("Click");       // Label = "Click",  ID = hash of (..., "Click")
       PushID("node");
       Button("Click");       // Label = "Click",  ID = hash of (..., "node", "Click")
         PushID(my_ptr);
           Button("Click");   // Label = "Click",  ID = hash of (..., "node", my_ptr, "Click")
         PopID();
       PopID();

   - Tree nodes implicitly creates a scope for you by calling PushID().

       Button("Click");       // Label = "Click",  ID = hash of (..., "Click")
       if (TreeNode("node"))  // <-- this function call will do a PushID() for you (unless instructed not to, with a special flag)
       {
         Button("Click");     // Label = "Click",  ID = hash of (..., "node", "Click")
         TreePop();
       }

   - When working with trees, ID are used to preserve the open/close state of each tree node.
     Depending on your use cases you may want to use strings, indices or pointers as ID.
      e.g. when following a single pointer that may change over time, using a static string as ID
       will preserve your node open/closed state when the targeted object change.
      e.g. when displaying a list of objects, using indices or pointers as ID will preserve the
       node open/closed state differently. See what makes more sense in your situation!
